# minesweeper_AI
***
Disclaimer: This project was completed as part of the Harvard CS50 Artifical Intelligence course. The implementation using pygame was done by staff at Harvard University.
The source code has not been changed.
I have written the functions in "minesweeper.py".

minesweeper_AI uses logical deduction and some set theory to deduce, if possible, safe next moves to make. Doing this project I realised how chance-based minesweeper inherently is.
A lot of the time the AI, despite being intelligent, will lose at the game simply because there is no way of working out a safe move, so it guesses randomly.

I learnt about how formal logic works including different logical statements and how a knowledge base is used to make further deductions. It was interesting to apply this and see 
a computer make seemingly independent, intelligent choices.
